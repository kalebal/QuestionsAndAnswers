# Atelier QuestionsAndAnswers API
A microservice API delivering user submitted questions and answers about specific clothing products.
## Description
The main goal of this project is to support the front end of a mock clothing retailer, replacing an existing back end in order to support the full data set (it's a large catalogue) and handle production level traffic.
The rebuilt API is able to handle up to 2500 requests per second with less than 5% error rate -- an increase of approximately 400%.
## Tools
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Testing: Loader.io, K6, Artillery
